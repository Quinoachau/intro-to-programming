# Signals

## Recommendations

Signals should be the *primary* state management tool inside of components. Do not use "raw" variables and rely on Zone.js or Angular's state management to keep the UI up to date.

Note: The use of observables within components is *fine*, but should be used when the same solution using Signals isn't feasaible. This is rare, and getting even less common. For example, The ReactiveForms module relies heavily on Observables, but Angular 21 will introduce Signal Based Forms instead.

Another area where Observables are heavily used is with the Angular `HttpClient`. The observables here can be converted to Signals with the `toSignal` method from the `rxjs/interop` package.
